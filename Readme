1. Change L5_ofdm_bit_adapt.c and L5_ofdm_power_adapt. Put your code between: 
	
	//***Student_code_start*** 
	//    Your code...
	//    ...
        //    ...
	//***Student_code_end*****

   Don't change other code.

2. You need to write following functions:

	int bit_allocation(int bitAlloc[], double gamma[], int numCarriers,
		double snrAvg, int modBitsPerSym[], double snrTh[], int numMods)
		
	int power_allocation(double powAlloc[], double gamma[], int numCarriers, double sqrtSNR)


3. Please make sure you have the latest version of "gcc"

4. Compile with command line:
	make

5. Excute with command line.
	./L5_ofdm_bit_adapt 8 5000 
	
	or 
	
	./L5_ofdm_power_adapt 8 5000
	
   E.g.:  5000 is blocknumber, more takes more time but more accurated. 8 is number of taps of frequency-selective fading.
   Your result will store in a .txt file in /result.

6. Plot your graph with Python script in /result/plot_bit_ber_and_throughput.py  or /result/plot_power_ber_and_throughput.py
